* About

This is a small Rust program to fetch the total amount of signatures
associated with a given address. The amount of signatures is directly
related to the number of transactions.

* Setting up the environment

If you have [[https://nixos.org/][Nix]] and [[https://direnv.net/][direnv]] installed, you may just run =direnv allow=
and the entire environment will be setup up for you without affecting
your global system.

Otherwise, setup Rust with [[https://rustup.rs/][rustup]].

* Compiling the system

Just run =cargo build --release= and the system will be built with a
nice optimization level.

* Running the system

Check the usage of the program with

#+begin_src sh
  ./target/release/get-signatures-for-address --help
#+end_src
